#  AIOps Learning Journey

Welcome to my **12-month journey** learning Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps), combining **Cloud**, **DevOps**, **SysOps**, and **AI** to solve real-world IT problems.

This repository documents my **progress, notes, hands-on projects, and experiments** as I train to become a professional AIOps Engineer.
