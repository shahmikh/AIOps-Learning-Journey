Bash Scripting : To automate tasks
Here are steps for bash scripting
- First you need to gather information
- You need to know about manual commands
- You need to maintain SHEBANG LINE (#!/bin/bash)
- SHEBANG LINE: It's the first line in code which tells the systemt to use which interpreter
- (#!/path/to/interpreter)
 - For bash : #!/bin/bash
 - For Python: #!/use/bin/pyhton3

# tr command ( use in file system )
syntax: tr <find> <replace>
example: tr [a-z] [A-Z]

Seq command ( to print number range )
syntax: seq <n>
example: 
seq (10) #This will print sequence from 1-10
seq -w 2 10 #This will print 2 4 6 8 10
seq -s '+' 10 #This will print 1+2+3...10

##Conditional Statements
- If else
- If then else
- Nested If else
Loops:
- For loop
- While loop
- Case statement
- 
Conditional statements are mostly used with loops

##echo command
syntax: echo "print my name"

echo $? #It will check whether the previous command was run or not and give us zero if it was successful
0=good
1+=error

##Operators

!= *not equal to*
> *greater than*
< *Less than*
-gt *greater than*
